Automation Home using EEG is an Android App that allows users brain-control all devices that are wirelessly connected to the app while wearing an EEG headset. The app is based on the fact that different human thoughts initiate different EEG patterns. The EEG signals are then collected through an EEG acquisition system such as an EEG headset, pre-processed to filter out noises (from movement, muscle artifacts, 60Hz, and the system itself). Since EEG signals are very small in amplitude (only a few microvolts), hugely affected by surrounding noises, and complex, machine learning is applied to detect common EEG patterns for each specific thought from each person, and hopefully eventually among different people. The aim is to let users add an unlimited number of devices with full control of each of them by just their thoughts. Automation Home using EEG is not just beneficial to disabled people, but also to all of us. If you have ever dreamed of having a magic wand like in Harry Potter, Automation Home using EEG can be the real-life version of it.
